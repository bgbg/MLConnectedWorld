# Machine Learning in the Connected World


This book introduces the reader to the world of machine learning on graphs. It is a project-based book, where the reader learns by doing.
In each part, we will introduce a new concept, learn the theory behind it, and then apply it to a real-world problem.

* The first part "**Connecting the dots**" introduces the reader to the world of graphs and graph algorithms. We'll learn what graphs are, basic terms and definitions, and how to work with graphs in Python. At the end of the part, we'll explore the fascinating concept of "small world phenomenon". (Key concepts: graphs, nodes, edges, adjacency matrix, adjacency list, breadth-first search, depth-first search, shortest path)

The second part "Measuring importance" dives into measures of centrality and authority. We'll explore concepts like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. You'll learn about *PageRank* - the algorithm that made Google what it is today. We will then apply these measures to identify key influencers in social networks.

The third part "Detecting communities" focuses on community detection algorithms. We'll learn about modularity, the Girvan-Newman algorithm, and the Louvain method. Our project will involve detecting communities in a social media network to understand group dynamics.

The fourth part "Flow of information" examines how information flows through networks. We'll cover concepts like diffusion models, influence maximization, and the spread of information. We'll apply these ideas to model the spread of information in a social network and identify strategies for maximizing influence.

The fifth part "Patterns in graphs" explores motifs in graphs. We'll learn about recurring subgraph patterns, their significance, and methods to detect them. We'll apply these concepts to identify common motifs related to fraud detection in financial networks and understand their implications.

The sixth part "Advanced topics" covers other relevant topics in machine learning on graphs, including graph neural networks, temporal networks, and dynamic graphs. We'll discuss how these advanced techniques can be applied to cutting-edge problems in various domains.
