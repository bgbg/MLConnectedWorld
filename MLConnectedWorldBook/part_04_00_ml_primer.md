# Machine Learning Primer

The chapters in this part of the book provide the absolute minimum necessary to understand the machine learning concepts and techniques used in the rest of the book. If you are already familiar with machine learning, you can skip this part.

These chapters were heavily based on the "Programming Collective Intelligence" book by Toby Segaran. The book is a great introduction to machine learning. I wish it was updated to include more recent techniques and tools, but it is still a great resource to learn the basics.
