# Connectivity 


Our goal is to create a lesson based on "Transitivity and Triads‚Äù by Tom A.B. Snijders from the University of Oxford, presented on May 14, 2012. The students know the basics of graph theory, know Python and networkx. The lesson will be a demonstrative python script that uses `jupytertext` format. Below is the lesson outline. 

## 1: Introduction to Transitivity and Triads
### 1.1: Overview of Transitivity in Graphs
### 1.2: Importance of Triads in Social Network Analysis
### 1.3: Connecting Transitivity and Triads to Machine Learning
### 1.4: Triads and Triplets: Key Differences
### 1.5: Algebraic Properties of Local Structures

## 2: Predicting Links in Social Networks

## 3: Markov Graphs and Network Models
### 3.1: Introduction to Markov Graphs
### 3.2: Probability Models for Graphs
### 3.3: Role of Triads in Probability Models

## 4: Practical Applications in Machine Learning
### 4.1: Predictive Models Incorporating Transitivity
### 4.2: Case Studies and Real-world Applications
