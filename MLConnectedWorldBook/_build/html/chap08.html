<h1>Strings and Regular Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#strings-and-regular-expressions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Strings are not like integers, floats, and booleans. A string is a <strong>sequence</strong>, which means it contains multiple values in a particular order.
In this chapter we’ll see how to access the values that make up a string, and we’ll use functions that process strings.</p>
<p>We’ll also use regular expressions, which are a powerful tool for finding patterns in a string and performing operations like search and replace.</p>
<p>As an exercise, you’ll have a chance to apply these tools to a word game called Wordle.</p>
<section id="a-string-is-a-sequence">
<h2>A string is a sequence<a class="headerlink" href="#a-string-is-a-sequence" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A string is a sequence of characters. A <strong>character</strong> can be a letter (in almost any alphabet), a digit, a punctuation mark, or white space.</p>
<p>You can select a character from a string with the bracket operator.
This example statement selects character number 1 from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fruit</span></code> and
assigns it to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">letter</span></code>:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fruit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;banana&#39;</span>
<span class="n">letter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fruit</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The expression in brackets is an <strong>index</strong>, so called because it <em>indicates</em> which character in the sequence to select.
But the result might not be what you expect.</p>

<div class="cell_input docutils container">

<div class="output text_plain highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&#39;a&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The letter with index <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> is actually the second letter of the string.
An index is an offset from the beginning of the string, so the offset of the first letter is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code>.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can think of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b</span></code> as the 0th letter of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">banana</span></code> – pronounced “zero-eth”.</p>
<p>The index in brackets can be a variable.</p>

<h2>String methods<a class="headerlink" href="#string-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Strings provide methods that perform a variety of useful operations.
A method is similar to a function – it takes arguments and returns a value – but the syntax is different.
For example, the method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upper</span></code> takes a string and returns a new string with all uppercase letters.</p>
<p>Instead of the function syntax <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">upper(word)</span></code>, it uses the method syntax <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word.upper()</span></code>.</p>

<p>I’ve downloaded the book in a plain text file called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pg345.txt</span></code>, which we can open for reading like this:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">reader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;pg345.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In addition to the text of the book, this file contains a section at the beginning with information about the book and a section at the end with information about the license.
Before we process the text, we can remove this extra material by finding the special lines at the beginning and end that begin with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">***</span></code>.</p>
<p>The following function takes a line and checks whether it is one of the special lines.
It uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">startswith</span></code> method, which checks whether a string starts with a given sequence of characters.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can use this function to loop through the lines in the file and print only the special lines.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">

</div>
</div>
<p>Now let’s create a new file, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pg345_cleaned.txt</span></code>, that contains only the text of the book.
In order to loop through the book again, we have to open it again for reading.
And, to write a new file, we can open it for writing.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">reader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;pg345.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">writer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;pg345_cleaned.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;w&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open</span></code> takes an optional parameters that specifies the “mode” – in this example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">w</span></code> indicates that we’re opening the file for writing.
If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created; if it already exists, the contents will be replaced.</p>
<p>As a first step, we’ll loop through the file until we find the first special line.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="k">break</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> statement “breaks” out of the loop – that is, it causes the loop to end immediately, before we get to the end of the file.</p>
<p>When the loop exits, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">line</span></code> contains the special line that made the conditional true.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reader</span></code> keeps track of where it is in the file, we can use a second loop to pick up where we left off.</p>
<p>The following loop reads the rest of the file, one line at a time.
When it finds the special line that indicates the end of the text, it breaks out of the loop.
Otherwise, it writes the line to the output file.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">reader</span><span class="p">:</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When this loop exits, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">line</span></code> contains the second special line.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>At this point <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reader</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">writer</span></code> are still open, which means we could keep reading lines from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reader</span></code> or writing lines to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">writer</span></code>.
To indicate that we’re done, we can close both files by invoking the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">close</span></code> method.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

<p>In the Icelandic translation of <em>Dracula</em> from 1901, the name of one of the characters was changed from “Jonathan” to “Thomas”.
To make this change in the English version, we can loop through the book, use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">replace</span></code> method to replace one name with another, and write the result to a new file.</p>

<h2>Regular expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#regular-expressions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>If we know exactly what sequence of characters we’re looking for, we can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> operator to find it and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">replace</span></code> method to replace it.
But there is another tool, called a <strong>regular expression</strong> that can also perform these operations – and a lot more.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, I’ll start with a simple example and we’ll work our way up.
Suppose, again, that we want to find all lines that contain a particular word.
For a change, let’s look for references to the titular character of the book, Count Dracula.
Here’s a line that mentions him.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And here’s the <strong>pattern</strong> we’ll use to search.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A module called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">re</span></code> provides functions related to regular expressions.
We can import it like this and use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">search</span></code> function to check whether the pattern appears in the text.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the pattern appears in the text, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">search</span></code> returns a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Match</span></code> object that contains the results of the search.
Among other information, it has a variable named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">string</span></code> that contains the text that was searched.</p>

<p>For this example, we didn’t have to use regular expressions – we could have done the same thing more easily with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> operator.
But regular expressions can do things the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code> operator cannot.</p>
<p>For example, if the pattern includes the vertical bar character, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code>, it can match either the sequence on the left or the sequence on the right.
Suppose we want to find the first mention of Mina Murray in the book, but we are not sure whether she is referred to by first name or last.

<p>Bram Stoker was born in Ireland, and when <em>Dracula</em> was published in 1897, he was living in England.
So we would expect him to use the British spelling of words like “centre” and “colour”.
To check, we can use the following pattern, which matches either “centre” or the American spelling “center”.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pattern</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;cent(er|re)&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this pattern, the parentheses enclose the part of the pattern the vertical bar applies to.
So this pattern matches a sequence that starts with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cent</span></code> and ends with either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">er</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">re</span></code>.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As expected, he used the British spelling.</p>
<p>We can also check whether he used the British spelling of “colour”.
The following pattern uses the special character <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">?</span></code>, which means that the previous character is optional.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This pattern matches either “colour” with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">u</span></code> or “color” without it.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">find_first</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, as expected, he used the British spelling.</p>
<p>Now suppose we want to produce an edition of the book with American spellings.
We can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sub</span></code> function in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">re</span></code> module, which does <strong>string substitution</strong>.</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pattern</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;color&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first argument is the pattern we want to find and replace, the second is what we want to replace it with, and the third is the string we want to search.
In the result, you can see that “colour” has been replaced with “color”.</p>

In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I

One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made
“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff

nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all

Liverpool Street was:--
“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”
“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;
shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,

sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had

her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”
We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not

child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made
It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst
Van Helsing turning to me, said:
“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not

was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must
have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.
It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I
could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the

presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the

breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”
“What do you make of it?”
“Well?” said Van Helsing.

_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently

room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.”
Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the

The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and
“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.
“I guess Art is the cause.”
He handed me a telegram:--
“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.”
Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”
Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart

Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched

“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be

In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to

When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel
in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped

Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the

To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
“Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”
“Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.
“Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand on

“Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”
“Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
At length he stammered out:--
“You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
of a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!” I could

“She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I
answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but

“You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,
you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--
“Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”
“Then what are you doing here?”
“My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”
“Then don’t stay.”
“But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be
pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--
“How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply
contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--
“What an asinine question!”
“I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once
“You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so

“Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.

When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind

ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
“Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”
As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion; at
which the Professor interrupted me:--
“Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain--a brain that a man
should have were he much gifted--and a woman’s heart. The good God

combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help

Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
centre. The Professor said:--

“I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at

The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.

“I fail to understand,” said Harker wearily. “Oh, do be more plain to

hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to
despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
“Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and
hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want
to see you: Mina.”
There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker’s voice:--
“Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!” Van Helsing turned to him
“God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
“Oh, hush, hush, my child!” said Van Helsing. “God does not purchase
souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep
faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be
coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,
is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.”
About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker’s telegram, there
the Professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and
Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood

“For him!” We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--

“He will be here before long now,” said Van Helsing, who had been
consulting his pocket-book. “_Nota bene_, in Madam’s telegram he went

Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming

“Why?” I asked.
“Is anything wrong?” he asked, in alarm.
“No,” I replied; “but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.”
“I will go,” he said, and hurried into the Professor’s room.
In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at
the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a
“Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,

turning to her, he said, cheerfully: “And what am I do for you? For at

“Where are you?” The answer came in a neutral way:--
“I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.” For several
minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina’s face, Dr. Van
Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed
itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--
“Where are you now?” The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
“What do you see?”
“What do you hear?” I could detect the strain in the Professor’s patient

By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina’s shoulders, and laid her
us all around her. “Have I been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.
She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the
“Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” Mr.
Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor’s calm
“Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor

forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but
that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the
Count’s mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan’s so fierce

following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He

“But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?” He
“Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all

_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van
Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan
Harker, Mina Harker.
Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--
“As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that
he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since
by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne
ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in
your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail,
however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go
out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from
Doolittle’s Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
Danube. ‘Soh!’ said I, ‘this is the ship whereon is the Count.’ So off
we go to Doolittle’s Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood
of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face
and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey
“They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and
him that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also

so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with God’s sanction,
shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together
that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God’s own wish: that the
world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
we fall, we fall in good cause.” He paused and I said:--
“But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven
from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from
“Aha!” he said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once

beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.
Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to

through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing
“With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned
often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she

It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has
_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was
experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a
without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each
part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was
confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--
“The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take
reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such
weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if
be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” Here Quincey Morris
“I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be
that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to
our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any
trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack
after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn’t we have given then for a repeater

_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the
same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought
for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found
room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.
“No,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. You can tell
Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment’s pause he

“You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,

together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” When he had
spoken, Mina’s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen

“And I!” said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to

pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.
_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every
similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who
was much impressed with Godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all

Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping
faint.” The telegrams from London have been the same: “no further
report.” Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--
“I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina’s. Souls and memories can do
strange things during trance.” I was about to ask him more, but Harker

for Galatz?” said Van Helsing to us generally.
“At 6:30 to-morrow morning!” We all started, for the answer came from
Mrs. Harker.
“How on earth do you know?” said Art.
“You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I

feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!”
I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face

“Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
those so bright eyes.” He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.

DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty

Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay

Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
Harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There

at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.
Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole

_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
of the _Czarina Catherine_.
_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the
Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.
_Jonathan Harker’s Journal._
_30 October._--At nine o’clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
on Messrs. Mackenzie &amp; Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of
Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
Godalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his

miscredit wi’ the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an’ the Old Mon who
hinderin’ him.” This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--
“Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
he know when he meet his match!” The skipper was not displeased with the

the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had

through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the
river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I’d let it

“What was the name of the man who took it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing with
cabin, produced a receipt signed “Immanuel Hildesheim.” Burgen-strasse
16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so
We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to
give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks
an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to

As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is
also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but
there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
Hildesheim.
That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_
made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson’s
played the Count’s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
Count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here
Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on
land_, at Galatz.
The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
aid in the work? In my husband’s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s
remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.
My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
close to Dracula’s castle as can be got by water.
_Mina Harker’s Journal--continued._
When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--
“Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where
to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
“I shall get a steam launch and follow him,” said Lord Godalming.
“And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,” said Mr.
Morris.
“Good!” said the Professor, “both good. But neither must go alone. There
must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
rough, and he carries rude arms.” All the men smiled, for amongst them
they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--
“I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and
there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points.” Dr.
Seward said:--
“I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don’t suppose these fellows carry
shall not rest until the Count’s head and body have been separated, and
we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate.” He looked at Jonathan as he
spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--
“Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she
me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be
landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy’s
of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz
over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
Mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” Here
Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--
“Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
Hell!” He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--
“Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
Have you felt the Vampire’s lips upon your throat?” Here he turned to
“Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and he sank
down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor’s voice, as he
“Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what

company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and
possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
“Do as you will,” said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, “we
are in the hands of God!”
_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing

_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
plans, we finally decided that Mina’s guess was correct, and that if any
waterway was chosen for the Count’s escape back to his Castle, the
Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took

<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When you are reading and writing files, debugging can be tricky.
If you are working in a Jupyter notebook, you can use <strong>shell commands</strong> to help.
For example, to display the first few lines of file, you can use the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!head</span></code>, like this:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">!</span>head<span class="w"> </span>pg345_cleaned.txt

<p>When you are working with large files, debugging can be difficult because there might be too much output to check by hand.
A good debugging strategy is to start with just part of the file, get the program working, and then run it with the whole file.</p>
<p>To make a small file that contains part of a larger file, we can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!head</span></code> again with the redirect operator, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>, which indicates that the results should be written to a file rather than displayed.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By default, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!head</span></code> reads the first 10 lines, but it takes an optional argument that indicates the number of lines to read.</p>

<p>This shell command reads the first 100 lines from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pg345_cleaned.txt</span></code> and writes them to a file called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pg345_cleaned_100_lines.txt</span></code>.</p>
<p>Note: The shell commands <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!head</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">!tail</span></code> are not available on all operating systems.

<h3>Ask a virtual assistant<a class="headerlink" href="#ask-a-virtual-assistant" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, we only scratched the surface of what regular expressions can do.
To get an idea of what’s possible, ask a virtual assistant, “What are the most common special characters used in Python regular expressions?”</p>
<p>You can also ask for a pattern that matches particular kinds of strings.
For example, try asking:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Write a Python regular expression that matches a 10-digit phone number with hyphens.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a Python regular expression that matches a street address with a number and a street name, followed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ST</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">AVE</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a Python regular expression that matches a full name with any common title like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mr</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Mrs</span></code> followed by any number of names beginning with capital letters, possibly with hyphens between some names.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want to see something more complicated, try asking for a regular expression that matches any legal URL.</p>
<p>A regular expression often has the letter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> before the quotation mark, which indicates that it is a <strong>raw string</strong>.
For more information, ask a virtual assistant, “What is a raw string in Python?”</p>

<h3>Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>“Wordle” is an online word game where the objective is to guess a five-letter word in six or fewer attempts.
Each attempt has to be recognized as a word, not including proper nouns.
After each attempt, you get information about which of the letters you guessed appear in the target word, and which ones are in the correct position.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the target word is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MOWER</span></code> and you guess <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TRIED</span></code>. You would learn that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">E</span></code> is in the word and in the correct position, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R</span></code> is in the word but not in the correct position, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">I</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D</span></code> are not in the word.</p>
<p>As a different example, suppose you have guessed the words <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SPADE</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CLERK</span></code>, and you’ve learned that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">E</span></code> is in the word, but not in either of those positions, and none of the other letters appear in the word.</p>

<h2>Exercise<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> is a novel by Alexandre Dumas that is considered a classic.
Nevertheless, in the introduction of an English translation of the book, the writer Umberto Eco confesses that he found the book to be “one of the most badly written novels of all time”.</p>
<p>In particular, he says it is “shameless in its repetition of the same adjective,” and mentions in particular the number of times “its characters either shudder or turn pale.”</p>
<p>To see whether his objection is valid, let’s count the number number of times the word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pale</span></code> appears in any form, including <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pale</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pales</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paled</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paleness</span></code>, as well as the related word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pallor</span></code>.
Use a single regular expression that matches all of these words and no others.</p>
