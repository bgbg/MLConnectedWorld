# Machine Learning in the Connected World

This project is an ongoing courseware for the course "Machine Learning on Graphs". 
The overall approach and teaching philosophy are inspired by the "Think X" series of books by Allen B. Downey. I studied and have been teaching from his books for years and I am a big fan of his work. 
The courseware infrastructure code is based on the "Think Python" 3rd edition book by Allen B. Downey. 

I extend my gratitude to Allen for his work and hope to contribute to the community with this project.
